<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I am a proud member of the University of North Carolina at Asheville Class of 2016. On May 7, I earned a Bachelor of Science in Atmospheric Sciences and a minor in Mathematics while graduating with distinction. My goal is to take what I have learned in the classroom and apply it to the real world, making a positive impact on the discipline along the way.</p>

<p>I have always had a passion for weather. It all started when I was very young and received a thermometer and a rain gauge. From there it grew into drawing weather maps and as I got older, recording daily minimum and maximum temperatures as observed by my La Crosse Technology weather station. I have wanted to have a career as a meteorologist for a long time and completing my undergraduate education at UNC Asheville was the next step along the path.</p>

<p>My hobbies include hiking, fishing, gaming, weather forecasting, and now to a lesser extent golfing. Some pictures that I have taken while exploring the mountains of western North Carolina are in the gallery below. During my time at UNCA, I participated in the WxChallenge and this competition has helped me to develop a love for forecasting the weather. I love the challenge of trying to predict the future and forecast verification is one of my favorite aspects of the forecast process because it helps me to fine-tune my skills, which in turn helps me to grow as a forecaster. I plan on remaining on the UNCA WxChallenge team as an alumni forecaster for the 2016-17 season and a portion of this website is actually dedicated to the competition.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to read a little bit about me and please feel free to contact me at any time! I look forward to seeing what the future will bring and my current forecast is for a sunny, bright future.</p>
